# Float Multiplier 9000: Stack Overfloat!

Do you want more muzzle flips? Do you want your eyes got hit by the sights? Do you want your arms being even weaker? Then you are in the right place!

Inspired by Wpotank's [wpotank gunbolt feedback](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/wpotank/wpotank_gunbolt_feedback/), the differences are:

- Modifying firearms' FVRFireArmRecoilProfile directly - does not mess up when operating the bolt, slide, etc.
- Full control (through multipliers and addends) on all recoil parameters: rotations, linear movements, etc.
- Per-weapon configurations!!!1!

## Known Issues and Limitations

- [![State-of-the-art Shitcode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=State-of-the-art&message=Shitcode&color=7B5804)](https://github.com/trekhleb/state-of-the-art-shitcode) There might be more bugs I havn't found
- The default values may not be suitable for all guns, feel free to adjust them in the config file. Per-weapon configurations are in the Niko666.UniversalRecoilControl.json file, located in the same place as the config files. (You can get the weapon's Object ID from the wrist menu iirc)
- DO NOT set some values to 0 however I don't know exactly which ones

## I Asked Myself These Questions

### It's really useless and glitchy

- Sorry, I'm not good at modding. If you have any suggestions, feel free tell me. (Discord: 妮可_Niko666, I'm in UTC+8 timezone so probably won't respond to messages in time)

### I want more

- I'll do my best.🫡

## Generative AI Disclosure

About 50% of the code (especially the per-weapon config part) was created using CodeGeeX GLM4.7 generative AI model because I'm a dumbass.
