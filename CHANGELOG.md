# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- Completely overhauled, now modifies FVRFireArmRecoilProfile parameters directly rather than modifying internally computed recoil values
- MFs I debugged this shit whole day just to find out that the code wasn't wrong, it was my default config that was wrong (accidently set MaxHorizontalRot_MultiplyAmount to 0, causing the gun disappearing when firing), Сука блядь

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
